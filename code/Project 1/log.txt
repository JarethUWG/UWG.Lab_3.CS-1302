    Improved documentation
    
    Added @throws in both method headers and javadocs where applicable for better documentation. Changed a few author tags to Jareth Batty as while the base sample was made by CS 1302 the rest of the project was made by Jareth Batty and thus it is more accurate to place him as the author. The sole exception to this is main which remains relativly intact from initial import thus the author remains the same.

    Test and debugging for Utility
    
    Only limited testing was possible due to both utilites interacting with UI componets in some way. IllegalArgumentExceptions added to both utility methods to protect against improper use in alternative implementations. Minor corrections to java docs for better discription in fuction.

    Tested and debugged food
    
    Tests were added for non-trivial methods in Food. toString was considered a trivial method and thus did not get a test. setNextQuantity had its upper bound removed due to being unused due to integer overflow. Correction was made to decrementQuantity exception message for more accurate error popups.

    Centralized Errors in Project
    
    Added a static method in Utility to minimize the amount of repetition in MainWindow error popups. RemoveFood() was unchanged due to not catching the exception like other methods thus not fitting the format.
